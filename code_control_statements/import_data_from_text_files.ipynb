    "In many applications of Python, you'll need to use data from an external source. For example, an Excel file with data tracking the various part ofa rocket or a text file to read the rocks that a moon rover sees. In this unit, we'll learn how to read data from a text file using a pre-made Python function.\n",

This may be in a Python folder or even on your desktop. Next, you'll need to save this [text.txt](./assets/text.txt) file. It's important that you save this file in the same location as your JUpyter Notebook file. This will make is easy to tell Python where to find the data.\n",
