    "# Chunk code into functions for easy reusability and readability\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use functions to make our code easier to read adn easier to reuse. For example, if you wrote code to count the number of basalt rocks, it would probably be almsot identical to the code needed to count highland rocks. Instead of making an if statement to chekc the type of every single space rock, we can give a function to the space rocks and it can run the same code to check which type of rock it is each timre. Print() is an example of a function where the code to display output to the screen is the same, and the only difference is what you want to display. In this unit, you'll learn how to twrite your own function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a function in Python, we must first tell Python that it is a function. WE use the word \"def\" to define a function (tellPython that the following code is a funciton). You msut hen include a name for your funciton, parenthesis, and a colon.\n",
    "Finally, at the end of your function you must include the \"return\" key word. This tells Python the function is done and to return to the point where you called the function. Notice that all code within the function, including the return statement, should be idented.\n"
